# Artificial Intelligence roadmap

I am not sure about the first doc I wrote. So I decided to write this one too:

1. edX: "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)".
    - What you'll learn: AI concepts, applications, and technologies.
2. Learnbay: "Executive Program in Data Science and AI".
    - What you'll learn: Core AI concepts and real-world applications.
3. Pluralsight: "Artificial Intelligence: Getting Started"
    - What you'll learn: Core AI concepts and real-world applications.
4. DataCamp: "Introduction to Python for Data Science"
    - What you'll learn: Basics of Python programming.
5. FutureLearn: "Artificial Intelligence: AI for Earth"
