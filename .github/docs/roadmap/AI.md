# Artificial Intelligence

To make a career in Artificial Intelligence (AI), you need:

1.  Computer Science Fundamentals:

    1. Python: [Python for Everybody](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/programming-for-everybody/).
    2. Data Structures & Algorithms: Code With Mosh – The Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms.
        - [Part 1](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/data-structures-algorithms-part-1/).
        - [Part 2](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/the-ultimate-data-structures-algorithms-part-2/).
        - [Part 3](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/the-ultimate-data-structures-algorithms-part-3/).

    -   [Git](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/the-ultimate-git-course/): you can learn git beside the previous subjects, it is not really prerequisite for anything but it will makes your life a lot easier if you know if.

2.  Mathematics and Statistics:

    **TBF IDK which is prerequisite for the other, as such I just used an unordered list here :|**.

    -   Linear Algebra: [Udemy Become a Linear Algebra Master](https://p30download.ir/fa/entry/98686/).

        Try [this one](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/mastering-linear-algebra-an-introduction-with-applications/) or [this one](https://p30download.ir/fa/entry/98617/) if "Udemy Become a Linear Algebra Master" was not helpful at all.

        **Not sure TBH if [this one](https://p30download.ir/fa/entry/99564/udemy-linear-algebra-and-geometry) is one that you should learn as AI engineer**, but any how I will keep its link and will remove it later if I realized that it is not needed :smile:.

    -   Calculus:

        -   [Become a Calculus 1](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/become-a-calculus-1-master/).
        -   [Become a Calculus 2](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/become-a-calculus-2-master/).
        -   [Become a Calculus 3](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/become-a-calculus-3-master/).

        If this course did not work check [this one](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/calculus-complete-course/).

    -   Probability and statistics: [Udemy – Become a Probability & Statistics Master](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/become-a-probability-statistics-master-9/).

3.  Machine Learning (ML):
    1. [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://downloadly.ir/elearning/video-tutorials/introduction-to-machine-learning-3/).
    2. Advanced Machine Learning: could not find anything as of now, but I guess when you finish the previous step you'll have a pretty good understanding of which course do you need and how you can find it.
4.  Deep Learning: There are quite a few courses online and I did not dare to add link to them. You can find them in downloadly.ir for example. But before anything it is highly perceptive of you if you seek a professional's giudance on this matter.
