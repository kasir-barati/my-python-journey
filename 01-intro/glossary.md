    Library

  <dd>
    A collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform specific tasks without building everything from scratch.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    Tell me like I am five: Imagine you have a big box full of toys, puzzles, and tools that help you do fun things, like building blocks to make a castle or crayons to draw a picture. Each toy or tool in the box saves you time because you don’t have to make it yourself—it’s just ready to use whenever you need it.

    Module

    Same meaning as the library, but sometimes can be used as an adjective too. Something composed of smaller, independent parts (modules) that can be combined or arranged in different ways.

    Data structure
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently.

    <a href="#objectOrientedProgrammingGlossary">#</a>
    Object-Oriented Programming
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A computer programming model that <b>organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic</b>.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    tell me like I am 5: You have different toys, like action figures, cars, and dolls. <b>Each</b> toy is different, but they can have <b>things in common</b> too -- like each one might have a color, a size, and things it can do (like move or make sounds).
  </dd>
  <dd>
    You might be confused with "rather than functions and logic" since if you think about it a toy making a sound is a function. So does not that goes against our definition for OOP?
    <br/>
    Nope, let's break it down:
    <ol>
      <li>We never said that OOP objects does not include functions.</li>
      <li>
        Unlike other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm">programming paradigms</a> that pass around data and focus on logics/function here we are gluing data and function together.
      </li>
    </ol>
